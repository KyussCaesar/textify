Start with some hybrid doc
replace certain keywords and stuff
output of that is an html doc
styling defined by css

references:
	default to APA style
	not really sure how to specify in line
	something that marks up a reference for you?
	maybe some kind of extra file where you specify

		resource title
		resource author
		resource type
		date published
		date acessed

specify reference inline with an id, some setting or cmdline option determines type.

	<p>I am talking about foo in this paragraph. It has been established that foo's are great for the purpose of bar <reference>fooref</reference>. We seek to further research in this area.</p>

Inside a references file;

	fooref:
		title: foos are awesome!;
		author : foo fighers;
		type : article;
		date_pub : 2001;
		date_acc : 2020;

Program will automatically build list of references in the specified style.

general form of reference inline:

	(author, year_published)

general form of reference in table:

	authors, (year). Title (edition, pages). Place of Publication. Publisher. Retrieved from:

sometimes there is info like "research paper" or "presentation" or "in communication" (i.e, "i talked to them")

maybe for now, default to an "APA-esque" style
